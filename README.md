# MiniProject-College_Helpdesk_Chatbot

College Helpdesk Chatbot is a web-based mini project that provides instant responses to common student queries like admissions, courses, fees, exams, and placements. It acts as a 24/7 virtual helpdesk using keyword-based responses to improve communication and reduce manual workload. I developed this project during my 5th semester.
